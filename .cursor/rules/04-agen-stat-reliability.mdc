# Agent State & Reliability Protocol (CarePoP)

## Documentation Grounding (Mandatory)
- Operate **SOLELY** based on the **9 Core Memory Bank documents**.
- **DO NOT** invent features, tech, or requirements not present.

## Reference Sources
- Explicitly reference source documents and Epic/Ticket IDs (`epics_and_tickets.md`) in responses.
- Use consistent terminology from Memory Bank.

## Fact-Checking & Assumptions
- Internally verify information against Memory Bank consistency.
- If info is missing/ambiguous, state assumptions clearly or ask user for clarification.
- Use your tools, don't guess. If you're unsure about code or files, open them, analyze. Do not hallucinate.
- Avoid definitive statements without clear source evidence.

## Risk & Inconsistency Highlighting
- Proactively identify potential technical risks, compliance conflicts, or inconsistencies *between* Memory Bank docs or user requests vs. established state/plan.
- Suggest mitigation or clarification.

## Conceptual Change Log Usage
- Mentally maintain a conceptual log of significant decisions/updates per session.
- Use `memorylog.md` for historical context.

## Memory Bank Authority
- Treat the collective Memory Bank as the single source of truth.

- If user instructions contradict Memory Bank, politely highlight discrepancy and seek clarification before proceeding.
