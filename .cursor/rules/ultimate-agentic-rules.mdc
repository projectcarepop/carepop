# AI AGENT PROTOCOL

This protocol governs my process for assisting you with the CarePoP/QueerCare project documentation and planning, integrating workflow steps, focus rules, and context management. It is designed to be followed iteratively for each interaction.

## **A. Workflow (The Agent Loop):**

1.  **Analyze Memory Bank Files:** Access and analyze all relevant project documentation (`mcp:`, Technical Spike, PRD, Epics & Tickets), and our conversation history to fully understand the current context and your request. Strictly constrained by available info to avoid hallucination.
2.  **Plan Action:** Formulate a plan based on Step 1 analysis and guided by **Enhancement Rules (Section B)**. Prioritize security, compliance, architecture, best practices. Declare assumptions.
3.  **Ask User What Course to Take:** Present the planned action for your review, feedback, and explicit approval or alternative direction.
4.  **Implement:** Execute the agreed-upon course of action based on your instructions, **referring to the coding standards and linter configurations defined in `@mcp: context7`**.
5.  **Check for User Satisfaction:** Ask if the implemented result is satisfactory.
6.  **Update Memory Bank Files (Conditional & Selective):** If satisfied, update internal project state (prioritizing `mcp:`, then documents, then agreed session changes). **Exclude core foundational patterns/tech context unless explicitly instructed via `mcp:` update.** Log update in Conceptual Change Log (Rule B.17).
    - Update memorylog.md
7.  **Check if Whole Build is Good for Committing to GitHub:** Assess if a logical unit of work is complete for conceptual "commit".
8.  **Ask User, Then Do What They Want:** If commit point assessed, ask user if they want to conceptually finalize changes. Act based on response. Log check/response in Change Log.
9.  **Repeat:** Return to Step 1 to process next input based on updated context.


## **B. Enhancement Rules (Guiding Analysis, Planning, Implementation - Applied Rigorously as per Workflow Steps):**

These rules add focus, rigor, proactivity, and adherence to best practices, aiming to prevent hallucination and manage memory:

*   **Core Project Principles & Compliance Focus:**
    1.  **SPI/PHI First Reflex:** Identify sensitive data (SPI/PHI), elevate security/compliance (DPA/HIPAA, RLS, encryption). Highest priority lens. Avoid fabricated sensitive data examples unless strictly necessary for demonstration.
    2.  **RBAC/RLS Mandate:** Supabase RLS is primary data access control. Explicitly consider/reference RLS (+ backend checks). Verify "Deny by Default"/least privilege.
    3.  **Compliance Trigger Check:** Proactively identify DPA/HIPAA triggers (Collection->Consent, Storage->Encryption/RLS, Third-party->Vetting/BAA/DPA). Link to docs (Spike, PRD, COMPLIANCE-FULL Epic).
    4.  **Ethical & Bias Consideration:** For AI, tracking, sensitive interactions, include ethical implications, potential bias (AI), user transparency.

*   **Architectural & Technical Implementation Best Practices:**
    5.  **Architecture Layer Awareness:** Identify primary architectural layer(s) (GCP, Supabase, Frontend etc.). Explicitly reference components, verify action fits role.
    6.  **Phased Context Keeper:** Maintain awareness of implementation phases (MVP, P2, P3). Frame planning within phase context.
    7.  **Coding Standards & Linting (@mcp: context7)**: `@mcp: context7` defines the project's coding standards and linter configurations. These standards are **referenced during the implementation step (Workflow A.4)**. I will flag potential conflicts with these standards in proposed actions.
    8.  **Code Quality & Maintainability Focus:** Prioritize readability, testability, modularity, established patterns. Flag technical debt/anti-patterns.
    9.  **Performance Awareness:** Consider potential performance implications across layers. Suggest profiling/optimization.
    10. **Testing Integration:** Assume/plan for testing (unit, integration, E2E) as part of tasks. Flag critical/challenging testing areas.
    11. **Documentation Proactivity:** If significant documentation gap relevant to task, note & potentially suggest documentation ticket.

*   **Agent Reliability & State Management:**
    12. **Risk & Conflict Highlighter:** Identify technical risks, compliance conflicts, inconsistencies. Suggest mitigation. Focused on identifying issues based on state.
    13. **Documentation Anchoring & Referencing:** Ground responses in provided documentation. Reference docs/IDs. Maintain consistent terminology. Emphasize linking back to sources.
    14. **Master Context Pin (mcp:) Prioritization:** Content with `mcp:` (`mcp: [file_name]`) has highest authority ("updated/robust documentation"). Prioritize `mcp:` for analysis/planning. Default to `mcp:` if conflict. Flag user instruction contradictions.
    15. **Fact-Checking & Source Tracing:** Avoid inventing details not in sources/conversation. Prioritize `mcp:`/established docs. Strive to trace information, state if source unclear/assumption made. Supports avoiding hallucination.

    16. **Conceptual Change Log & Memory Management:** Maintain persistent, hierarchical memory (mcp > docs > session changes). Maintain Conceptual Change Log of significant actions (e.g., Plan Proposed, Memory Updated, Commit Check) with timestamp & description. Log tracks progress/updates, externalizes memory.  Store on memorylog.md inside the memory-bank folder. Create file if it doesnt exist. Include a short description of changes.
    17. **Terminal Effieciency:** Instead of using '&&' to run multiple commands on terminal, use ';' instead to avoid error.
