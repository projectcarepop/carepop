   * Functionality: Registration (Sign Up), secure login (Sign In), profile viewing/editing, password management, viewing linked data (Health Records, Transactions, Tracking data).
   * Technical Implementation: Foundational security module leveraging Supabase Authentication for user registration, login, and token management. Supabase PostgreSQL for user profile data (in a dedicated profiles table linked to Supabase Auth users). Robust password policies enforced via Supabase Auth. Rate limiting managed at the API layer (Google Cloud Run Functions or Supabase Edge Functions). MFA consideration (esp. for staff) might involve Supabase features or custom implementation on Cloud Run. Database schema design in Supabase to link user accounts securely. Strict RBAC enforcement via Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) on tables and complementary application-level checks in backend code running on Cloud Run. Mandatory DPA Compliance: Clear privacy notices and granular explicit consent collection required for SPI processing (virtually all linked data), stored and managed in Supabase with RLS.
   * UI/UX: Simple forms, clear navigation to linked sections. Visual indicators for strong passwords.
* * 7.2. Appointment Scheduling Module:
   * Functionality: Online booking, provider/facility browsing (directory integration), schedule management (admin/provider), appointment confirmations, cancellations, reminders.
   * Technical Implementation: Backend APIs (Google Cloud Run Functions or Supabase Edge Functions) handle core scheduling logic: fetching provider availability, allowing slot selection, processing booking requests. Supabase PostgreSQL for data storage with appropriate schema for provider availability and appointments. Database transactions in Supabase ensure atomicity. Integration with Notification Service (background tasks triggered via Google Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run Function or Supabase Edge Function). Google Maps Integration: Use Geocoding API (addresses to coords, potentially triggered by a backend function on Cloud Run/Supabase) and Maps SDKs/Embed API (display maps on frontend). Recommend deep-linking over complex in-app navigation. Secure API key management using Google Cloud Secret Manager.
   * UI/UX: Visually clear availability display (calendars), straightforward booking flow, easily confirm/cancel appointments, prominent reminder displays. Interactive maps integrated seamlessly or via clear link.
* * 7.3. AI-Assisted Health Assessment, Tracking & Medication Module:
   * Functionality: AI health assessment (initial low-risk scope), Pill Tracker (logging, scheduling, reminders), Menstrual Tracker (logging, symptom tracking, reminders), general health tracking.
   * Technical Implementation: AI Assessment: Utilize NLP (spaCy/NLTK/cloud services like AWS Comprehend Medical etc.). RECOMMENDATION: Implement NLP processing logic in a dedicated Google Cloud Run service to manage complexity, sensitive data handling (decrypting data fetched from Supabase, processing, anonymizing results), and third-party API calls. AVOID automated diagnosis/treatment due to clinical risk, validation complexity, and NPC AI guidelines. Vet third-party AI carefully for compliance (BAA/DPA). Flexible time-series database schema in Supabase PostgreSQL for tracking data. Reliable background task execution for reminders (triggered via Google Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run Function).
   * Data Sensitivity: Pill Tracker and Menstrual Tracker data are SPI (health/sexual life). MANDATORY: Highest security measures, including application-level AES-256-GCM encryption before storing data in Supabase, rigorous Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), and strict application-level access control in backend code (Cloud Run Functions/Services) for provider view are required. Explicit user consent and strict access control for provider view are required, enforced via RLS and code checks. Data segregation consideration (via Supabase schemas and RLS policies) is important. Anonymization needed for reporting via Cloud Run Function.
   * UI/UX: Simple, non-judgmental input interfaces. Clear data visualization (graphs/charts) for tracking progress. Easy reminder setup and clear reminders. Design must handle sensitive topics discreetly and respectfully.
* * 7.4. Healthcare Provider & Location Directory Module:
   * Functionality: Curated directory of providers/facilities, search (specialty, location, preferences like LGBTQ+-affirming care, language), location display/mapping integration, admin management of data.
   * Technical Implementation: Supabase PostgreSQL recommended for structured data. Efficient indexing for search. Admin interfaces for data management (add, edit, verify, deactivate) via backend APIs (Google Cloud Run Functions) protected by Supabase RLS and application-level RBAC checks. Crucially, data quality mechanisms (validation, workflows, audits) are essential for user trust and SEO accuracy, implemented in backend code. Geocoding on create/update potentially via a Cloud Run Function.
   * UI/UX: Visually clean listings with key info prominent. Intuitive search and filtering UI. Well-integrated maps. Clear visuals conveying LGBTQIA+-affirming status if applicable.
   * SEO (Primary Focus): Public-facing directory listings MUST be crawlable and indexable. Implement SSR/SSG for these pages on the web version. Utilize Schema.org markup (MedicalOrganization, Physician) for providers/facilities. Use clean, semantic URLs. Optimize page titles and meta descriptions.
* * 7.5. Medicine Inventory Management Module:
   * Functionality: (Admin focused) Tracking stock levels, locations, expiry dates for medical supplies/medications. Reporting (reorder needs, expiry alerts). Potential advisory check integration with prescribing.
   * Technical Implementation: Accessible via backend APIs (Google Cloud Run Functions) protected by Supabase RLS and application-level RBAC (admin/staff) checks. Supabase PostgreSQL schema for inventory items. Recommended Phasing: Initially a standalone admin tool calling backend APIs; later phases may introduce loose coupling with prescribing via backend logic. Robust alerts for low stock/expiry potentially triggered by Google Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run Function.
   * UI/UX: Clear list views, easy data entry forms for admin users. Visual alerts for low stock.
* * 7.6. Reporting Module:
   * Functionality: (Admin focused) Generate reports (platform usage, appointment statistics, inventory levels, user demographics, tracking summaries). Support data-driven decision making.
   * Technical Implementation: Backend data aggregation (Google Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run Function) accessing data from Supabase. Secure admin dashboard display via backend APIs (Google Cloud Run Functions) protected by Supabase RLS and application-level RBAC. CRITICAL for sensitive data: Apply ROBUST anonymization techniques (Cloud Run Function) BEFORE aggregation to comply with DPA/HIPAA. Consult privacy experts. Strict adherence to DPA purpose limitation principle.
   * UI/UX: Clear display of aggregated reports. Optional charts/visualizations for clarity. Intuitive export options. Clear indication if sensitive reports are anonymized.
* Role-Based Access Control:
The platform is designed with explicit role-based permissions. Access to specific modules, features, and data will be strictly governed by user roles (Patient/General User, Healthcare Provider/Doctor/Staff, Administrator). This ensures users only access functionalities and information relevant and permitted for their role, reinforcing security and maintaining appropriate levels of access (as confirmed by FDDs, Use Cases, and Admin's "Manage User Permissions" capability in the original document). This is achieved primarily through Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies applied directly to the database tables, supplemented by application-level checks within backend code running on Google Cloud Run Functions/Services for complex scenarios or actions requiring elevated privileges. This applies to all modules and features, including access to individual Health Records, Lab Results, Transaction History, managing the Pill Tracker and Menstrual Tracker (user-specific access enforced by RLS), and viewing aggregate/anonymized data in Reports (admin access enforced by RLS and backend checks). The Deny by Default principle is inherent in Supabase RLS and must be followed in application-level checks.
Cross-Platform Benefit: Utilizing React Native for both web and mobile interfaces offers significant advantages in development speed, maintenance, and ensuring feature parity across platforms, directly addressing the goal of accessibility via both web and mobile applications mentioned in the original document.
8. Cross-Platform Strategy
The platform will utilize React Native CLI for core development. While allowing significant code reuse for business logic, careful attention is required for UI components, as they render natively on mobile vs. using the DOM on web. Achieving feature parity and a consistent visually appealing experience across platforms demands careful design and testing. Critically, for the web target and SEO, public-facing routes will require SSR/SSG implementation, likely using a supplementary framework integrated with React Native for Web.
9. Architecture & Technology Stack Recommendations
Based on project needs, security imperatives, and the technical spike:
* Frontend Framework: React Native (CLI) with SSR/SSG capability for public web routes (e.g., Next.js integration).
* Frontend Language: TypeScript.
* Navigation: React Navigation or similar.
* State Management: Redux Toolkit (Recommended for complex state, predictability, tooling). Consider starting with Zustand for faster MVP if appropriate, with planned migration.
* UI Library: Consider React Native Paper or similar, customized heavily to match desired modern, inclusive visual design.
* Backend Architecture: Supabase + Google Cloud Run Hybrid. Supabase for core data (PostgreSQL), Authentication, RLS, Storage, and simpler Functions. Google Cloud Run for more complex/dedicated backend logic, integrations, background jobs. Logical separation aligns with Modular Monolith principles.
* Backend Language: Node.js (with TypeScript) - primarily for Google Cloud Run services and potentially some Supabase Edge Functions.
* Backend Framework: Minimal framework on Cloud Run (Fastify or Express if preferred for structure). Leverage Supabase auto-generated APIs via its SDK where sufficient.
* Database + Auth + BaaS: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, RLS, Storage, Edge Functions). Primary data store, handles user auth and granular access control via RLS.
* ORM/Query Builder: Supabase SDK + direct SQL queries (for RLS). Use Supabase client library for interaction. May use Prisma or TypeORM within Google Cloud Run services if preferred for complex logic.
* Security Libraries: Node.js crypto (AES, scrypt - for application-level encryption), bcrypt (if needed outside Supabase Auth), jsonwebtoken (use cautiously for custom tokens only), joi/validator.js (for input validation in Cloud Run). Supabase Auth features replace custom auth logic.
* Logging Library: Winston or Pino (in Google Cloud Run). Leverage Supabase built-in logging.
* Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL backups, Cloud Secret Manager, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, Cloud Scheduler, Cloud CDN) + Supabase Platform. Evaluate GCP region presence, compliance support (DPA/HIPAA).
* Key 3rd Parties: Google Maps Platform, Notification Provider (e.g., AWS SNS/FCM/Twilio), AI/NLP Service (TBD), Payment Gateway (TBD if needed), Supabase (itself as a vendor). Essential external services. Supabase is a critical managed service dependency requiring full vetting.
10. Security, Compliance, and Data Privacy Architecture
This is a fundamental pillar of the platform.
* Holistic Security: Implement security throughout the SDLC (security-by-design). Rigorous input validation/output escaping (in Cloud Run/Supabase Functions), dependency management (scanning/patching), secure error handling (in Cloud Run), security headers (web), comprehensive logging/monitoring (Supabase logs, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring), regular security testing (SAST, DAST, pentesting).
* Data Encryption: MANDATORY: Application-level AES-256-GCM for encryption of ALL SPI/PHI at rest before storing in Supabase, in addition to Supabase infrastructure encryption. Encryption/decryption logic implemented in trusted backend code (Cloud Run Functions/Services). Secure TLS/HTTPS for all traffic (Supabase, Cloud Run). Robust, external Key Management using Google Cloud Secret Manager for application encryption keys.
* Data Segregation: Strong consideration given to leveraging Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) as the primary mechanism for logical data segregation within the PostgreSQL database, restricting access based on authenticated user/roles (auth.uid(), auth.role()). Complex access logic or processing of sensitive data (anonymization) handled in trusted Google Cloud Run services accessing data via Supabase service role key and applying application-level checks/processing.
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Core security mechanism. Define clear roles (Supabase Auth). Granular permissions enforced primarily via Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies on database tables, supplemented by application-level checks in Cloud Run Functions/Services. Mapping happens implicitly through RLS rules and user attributes/roles in Supabase Auth. Deny by Default principle enforced by RLS and code. Log decisions (Supabase logs, Cloud Logging). Potential need for ABAC elements leveraging RLS.
* Philippines Data Privacy Act (RA 10173): Compliance is mandatory for all operations. Applies to Filipino data subjects regardless of hosting location. Strict requirements for SPI processing (health, sexual life data). Requires explicit, informed, granular consent (stored in Supabase with RLS). Mandates "appropriate security measures" (Supabase RLS, application encryption via Cloud Run, access controls, Cloud Run security, Google Cloud Secret Manager). Requires Breach Notification (72 hours). May require DPO appointment and NPCRS registration (documenting Supabase/Cloud Run setup). Requires adequate protection for international data transfers (vet Supabase hosting location).
* HIPAA (if applicable): May become mandatory. Overlaps significantly with DPA principles (Technical Safeguards: Access Control - via Supabase RLS & Cloud Run checks, Audit Controls - via Supabase/Cloud Logging, Integrity, Authentication - via Supabase Auth, Transmission Security - via HTTPS/TLS on Supabase/Cloud Run). Requires Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with relevant third parties handling ePHI. This includes Supabase and relevant Google Cloud Platform services.
11. Third-Party Service Integration Strategy
Utilize external services for specific capabilities, selected based on technical suitability, security posture, and DPA/HIPAA compliance assurances. Integrations will typically be handled by backend code running on Google Cloud Run Functions/Services. Supabase itself should be evaluated as a key third-party dependency regarding its security posture and compliance readiness (HIPAA/DPA BAA).
* Google Maps Platform: Geocoding (via Cloud Run Function), Maps display (Frontend). Secure API key management (Google Cloud Secret Manager), usage monitoring.
* Notification Services: Push (APNS/FCM), SMS, Email. Reliable delivery, robust backend triggering (Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run Function). Critical: Secure handling of tokens/contact info, strict adherence to messaging consent, and NEVER include SPI/PHI directly in notification payload (only prompt to open secure app). Vet providers for compliance. Integration via Cloud Run Function.
* AI/NLP Services: (TBD based on scope). Rigorous evaluation required based on accuracy, clinical validity, integration complexity, and crucial compliance support (BAAs, DPA guarantees). Integration via a dedicated Google Cloud Run service.
* Payment Gateway (If Applicable): Secure integration (minimize PCI-DSS scope), vet providers for security and compliance. Integration via Cloud Run Function.
12. Identified Technical Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
Key challenges and mitigation:
* Security & Compliance: Ensuring robust security and compliance (HIPAA/DPA) across the entire platform, particularly with the hybrid Supabase/Cloud Run model. Mitigation: Adopt a security-by-design approach. Rigorous vetting of Supabase for HIPAA/DPA compliance (requiring BAA if applicable). Implement comprehensive security controls including strong application-level encryption (AES-256-GCM) for sensitive data before storage in Supabase, leveraging Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for granular access control, implementing application-level checks in Cloud Run functions/services, rigorous input validation, secure coding practices (OWASP guidelines), secure secrets management (Google Cloud Secret Manager), regular vulnerability scanning and patching, and thorough audit logging (Supabase logs + Cloud Logging). Consider data segregation strategies within Supabase using schemas and RLS. Engage compliance experts early and conduct regular security audits and penetration tests. Ensure necessary agreements (BAAs) are in place with third-party vendors (including Supabase). Stay updated on NPC and HHS regulations and guidance.
* Cross-Platform UI/UX Consistency & Appeal: React Native bridge differences exist. Mitigation: Prioritize strong UI/UX design process upfront, define comprehensive design system, utilize consistent UI library components customized for the platform's look. Rigorous testing on target devices and browsers. Allocate time for platform-specific visual adjustments.
* Performance: For data-heavy features and complex interactions. Mitigation: Apply RN best practices (FlatList, Hermes), profiling, optimization techniques. Optimize database queries and RLS policies in Supabase for efficient data retrieval. Profile application performance (frontend and backend/Cloud Run).
* Backend Architecture Management: Managing the complexity of the hybrid Supabase/Cloud Run backend architecture, particularly coordinating logic between Supabase features (Auth, RLS, Functions) and custom Cloud Run services. Mitigation: Clearly define the responsibilities of Supabase (data, auth, RLS) and Cloud Run (complex logic, integrations). Enforce strict RLS policies as the primary access control. Use Supabase Edge Functions for simpler serverless tasks tightly coupled to the DB, and Cloud Run for more complex or independent services. Establish clear API contracts between services. Implement comprehensive automated testing and CI/CD pipelines for both Cloud Run and frontend deployments. Invest in monitoring and logging from the beginning (Supabase logs, Cloud Logging).
* Reliable Background Tasks/Notifications: Essential for reminders. Mitigation: Select robust libraries for background task execution in React Native. Use Google Cloud Scheduler to trigger Cloud Run Functions/Services for backend reminder logic. Design for fault tolerance. Integrate with reliable push notification services. Ensure compliance regarding notification content and consent.
* AI Implementation (Safe/Ethical): Clinical and ethical risks of automated advice. Mitigation: Begin with low-risk AI applications, such as summarizing user input or providing links to curated information. Prioritize transparency and user consent. Implement AI integration logic in a dedicated Google Cloud Run service that vets input/output and handles sensitive data carefully (potentially requires decrypting data fetched from Supabase, processing it, and anonymizing results, then encrypting again if storing). Thoroughly vet any third-party AI services for accuracy, bias, clinical validity, and compliance (requiring BAAs/DPAs). Adhere to emerging AI regulations and guidelines.
* Data Quality: Ensuring and maintaining high data quality in dynamic datasets like the provider directory and medicine inventory, potentially managed via Supabase. Mitigation: Implement strict data validation rules (frontend and backend/Cloud Run Functions/Supabase Functions). Design clear, robust administrative workflows for data verification and updates (UI calling Cloud Run Functions/Supabase Functions interacting with Supabase). Incorporate regular data audits. Consider mechanisms for user feedback or flagging.
* Securely implementing granular access control for complex scenarios: Like a provider viewing only their assigned patients' data with consent using Supabase RLS and backend logic. Mitigation: Design Supabase RLS policies that join relevant tables (users, providers, patients, consents). Supplement RLS with application-level checks in Cloud Run functions/services where RLS alone is insufficient, using a Supabase service role key carefully and performing checks within the trusted function. Rigorously test RLS policies and backend access logic.
