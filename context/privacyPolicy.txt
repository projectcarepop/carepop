**5. Sharing and Disclosure of Your Information**

We are committed to not selling your personal information. We share your information only in limited, specific circumstances:

Access is role-based and governed by the principle of least privilege.
*   **With FPOP Administrative Staff:** Limited, authorized FPOP administrative staff may access necessary information for operational support, user support, managing the provider directory, or system administration, under strict confidentiality obligations and role-based access.

*   **Business Transfers (Future):** If FPOP or the CarePoP/QueerCare platform undergoes a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to undertakings of confidentiality by the acquiring party.
*   **With Your Explicit Consent:** We will share your information with other third parties only with your prior explicit consent.

**6. Data Security**

We implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate organizational, physical, and technical security measures designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal and sensitive personal information from accidental or unlawful destruction, alteration, and disclosure, as well as against any other unlawful processing. Key measures include:
*   **Application-Level Encryption:** Sensitive Personal Information (e.g., health tracking data) is encrypted using AES-256-GCM (via a backend Cloud Run utility - SEC-E-2) before it is stored in the Supabase database.
*   **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted between your device/browser and our servers (Supabase, Cloud Run) is encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
*   **Access Controls:** Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) and Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) are implemented in the backend to restrict data access based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Secure Authentication:** User authentication is managed via Supabase Auth, with secure password hashing.
*   **Secure Infrastructure:** Utilizing secure cloud infrastructure (Supabase, GCP) configured with security best practices.
*   **Secrets Management:** Securely managing API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys using Google Cloud Secret Manager.
*   **Regular Security Assessments:** Performing vulnerability scans and planning for penetration testing.
*   **Data Minimization:** Collecting only the data necessary for the declared purposes.

Despite these measures, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**7. Data Retention**

We retain your personal information and SPI only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (e.g., for medical record keeping requirements where applicable, DPA provisions, or other legal obligations). When your information is no longer needed, or upon a valid deletion request, it will be securely deleted or anonymized in accordance with our Data Retention Policy (reference COMPLIANCE-4).
