Welcome to CarePoP/QueerCare (the "Platform"), operated in partnership with the Family Planning Organization of the Philippines (FPOP) ("We", "Us", "Our"). The Platform provides access to healthcare information, provider directories, appointment scheduling, personal health tracking tools, and related services (collectively, the "Services") via our native mobile application (`carepop-nativeapp` for iOS and Android) and our web application (`carepop-web` accessible via web browsers).

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Platform and Services. By accessing or using the Platform, creating an account, or clicking to accept these Terms when presented, you ("User", "You") agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy ([Link to Privacy Policy when available]). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform or Services.

**2. Description of Service**

CarePoP/QueerCare is a digital platform designed to enhance healthcare accessibility and efficiency, particularly for diverse and underserved communities in Quezon City, Philippines. Core features available through both the native mobile app and the web application include:
*   User account management for secure access.
*   Online appointment scheduling with participating providers/clinics.
*   A directory of healthcare providers and facilities.
*   Tools for personal health tracking (e.g., Pill Tracker, Menstrual Tracker).
*   Access to view personal health information summaries or results where applicable and made available by providers (subject to consent and provider participation).
*   Web-based administrative interfaces for FPOP staff (covered by internal FPOP policies in addition to these terms where applicable).

**3. Healthcare Disclaimers - VERY IMPORTANT**

*   **Not Medical Advice:** The content and tools provided on the Platform (including information displayed, tracking summaries, directory listings, or any AI-assisted features) are for informational purposes only. The Platform **DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS.** Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read or used on the Platform.

*   **Not for Emergencies:** **DO NOT USE THE PLATFORM FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES.** If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call your local emergency number immediately or go to the nearest emergency room.

Accuracy of provider information in the directory is maintained to the best of our ability but relies on provider updates; verify details with providers directly.
