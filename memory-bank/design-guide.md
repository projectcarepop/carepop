Here are key resources covering UI/UX guidelines relevant to a cross-platform React Native application:
Material Design (by Google):
Link: https://m3.material.io/ (Material Design 3 - the latest version)
Relevance: This is one of the most popular design systems globally. It provides comprehensive guidelines for a wide range of components (buttons, text fields, navigation bars, cards, dialogs, etc.), layout, typography, color, and motion. Many React Native component libraries (like React Native Paper) are based on Material Design principles, making this a very practical guide if you adopt such a library. It's widely accepted and can provide a modern, consistent look and feel across Android, iOS, and web.
Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG):
Link: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
Relevance: If maintaining a native iOS look and feel is important on Apple devices (even within a cross-platform app), the HIG is the definitive source. It covers iOS-specific patterns, component usage, navigation paradigms, and overall design philosophy for the Apple ecosystem. While React Native aims for cross-platform, understanding HIG helps create experiences that feel natural to iOS users.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):
Link: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/ (WCAG 2.1) or https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/ (WCAG 2.2 - latest recommendation)
Relevance: CRITICAL for CarePoP/QueerCare's goal of serving diverse communities, including potentially users with disabilities. WCAG provides globally recognized standards for making digital content accessible to a wider range of people. While primarily for web, its principles apply directly to mobile apps (especially regarding perceivability, operability, understandability, and robustness) and should guide the design and implementation of all your components to ensure they are usable by everyone (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, clear focus indicators).
Documentation of your Chosen Component Library (If Applicable):
Example (React Native Paper): https://reactnativepaper.com/
Relevance: If you choose to use a library like React Native Paper, NativeBase, or UI Kitten, their documentation will provide specific usage guidelines, available props for customization, and examples for their versions of common components (Buttons, TextInputs, etc.). This is a practical, implementation-level guide based on the design system the library follows (often Material Design).
General UI/UX Principles & Heuristics:
Example (Nielsen Norman Group's 10 Usability Heuristics): https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/
Relevance: These are broader principles (like visibility of system status, match between system and the real world, error prevention, help and documentation) that should inform the design of user flows and interactions using your components. They provide a foundational understanding of what makes interfaces intuitive and effective, especially important for sensitive healthcare interactions.
Recommendation for How to Use These:
Choose a primary Design System: Decide if you will predominantly follow Material Design (often easier for cross-platform consistency and with libraries like RN Paper) or if you need to adhere strictly to iOS HIG on Apple devices.
Prioritize WCAG: Integrate accessibility considerations from WCAG into your design and implementation process from the beginning for all components and flows.
Consult Component Library Docs: If using a component library, rely on its documentation for the specifics of using and styling its components according to your chosen design system and accessibility needs.
Apply General Principles: Use the usability heuristics and general UI/UX principles to guide how components are arranged, how user tasks are supported, and how feedback is provided.
