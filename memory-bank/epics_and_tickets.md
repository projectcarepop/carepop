2.  **Ticket ID:** SEC-BE-2 (UPDATED for Cloud Run/Supabase Auth - Serving All Clients)

    *   **Background:** Create reusable middleware (**for Google Cloud Run services** or utilize **Supabase Edge Function auth features**) to protect backend endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users (from **native mobile or web clients**) can access them and fetching the user's identity/roles (**from Supabase Auth**) for subsequent checks.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Middleware function created (**for Google Cloud Run, or utilize Supabase Edge Function auth helper**) that intercepts requests to protected routes.
        *   Middleware checks for a valid authentication token (JWT) in the request headers (`Authorization: Bearer ...`).
        *   **Utilizes Supabase JS SDK (or built-in Edge Function helpers) to verify token validity (`supabase.auth.getUser(token)` or similar logic) and retrieve the authenticated user's object/ID from Supabase Auth.**
        *   Looks up the corresponding user's roles (**from Supabase Auth `app_metadata` or related tables in Supabase**) and attaches user object/ID and roles to the request context (e.g., `req.user`).
        *   Allows valid requests to proceed, sends 401 Unauthorized for invalid/missing tokens.
        *   Apply this middleware to a non-auth endpoint to confirm functionality.
    *   **Technology/Implementation Suggestions:** Node.js/TypeScript middleware (**for Cloud Run**). **Supabase JS SDK Auth helpers**, **Supabase Edge Functions built-in auth helpers**.

3.  **Ticket ID:** SEC-BE-3 (UPDATED for Supabase RLS & Backend Checks - Serving All Clients)
    *   **Title:** Implement Core RBAC Enforcement (**Supabase RLS & Backend Checks for All Clients**)
    *   **Background:** Build logic to enforce permissions based on user roles and data ownership, primarily leveraging **Supabase RLS**, supplemented by checks within backend code (**Cloud Run Functions/Services**) where RLS is insufficient (e.g., admin actions, complex data relationships). This backend logic serves **both native mobile and web clients**.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Supabase RLS policies** designed and implemented for core data access scenarios based on user roles (`auth.role()`) and user ID (`auth.uid()`) on relevant tables.
        *   **Backend code (Cloud Run functions/services)** implements explicit authorization checks for complex scenarios or actions requiring elevated privileges (e.g., admin actions like managing any user profile, or processes needing to read potentially all sensitive data for aggregation/anonymization). These checks use user/role info from authenticated context (SEC-BE-2) and might involve querying `roles` or `user_roles` tables in **Supabase**.
        *   **Logic in backend code uses a Supabase `service_role` key *only when necessary* (e.g., for admin actions or data aggregation before anonymization)**, but *always* performs application-level authorization *after* obtaining the user context. Access using `service_role` is logged (SEC-A-1).
        *   Implement **Deny by Default** principle via **Supabase RLS** (it's deny by default unless `ALLOW` policies exist) and application code.
        *   Integrate this logic into at least one authenticated API endpoint (e.g., PROF-2, PROF-3) to verify enforcement.
        *   Admin actions and sensitive data access attempts logged (SEC-A-1).
    *   **Technology/Implementation Suggestions:** **Supabase RLS**, **Supabase JS SDK (`service_role` key usage)**, Node.js/TypeScript application logic (**in Cloud Run functions/services**).

    *   **Title:** Implement Secure Client-Side Authentication Token Storage & Retrieval (**Supabase Token for Native Mobile & New Web App**)
    *   **Background:** Store and retrieve the **Supabase Authentication token (JWT)** received from the backend (**FOUND-10 Cloud Run function**) securely on the user's device/browser for **both the native mobile app and the new web application**.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Native Mobile App:** A secure client-side storage solution integrated (e.g., `expo-secure-store` or `@react-native-community/keychain`).
        *   **New Web Application (Next.js):** Secure token handling (e.g., HttpOnly cookies if using Next.js backend features for auth proxying, or other secure browser storage if calling APIs directly from client-side Next.js).
        *   **Supabase Auth token** from successful login is stored using the secure solution appropriate for each client.
        *   Stored token can be securely retrieved when needed for authenticated API calls (**to Supabase auto-generated APIs or Cloud Run functions**) from each client.
        *   Logout functionality removes the token securely from storage on each client.
        *   Tested on both native mobile platforms and web browsers regarding storage location validity and security implications.
    *   **Technology/Implementation Suggestions:** **Native:** `expo-secure-store`. **Web (Next.js):** HttpOnly Secure cookies (preferred for SSR/backend context), or secure browser storage mechanisms if client-side only. **Supabase JS SDK methods for session management on clients.**
