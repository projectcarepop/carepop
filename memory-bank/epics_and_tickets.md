    *   **Background:** Create reusable middleware (**for Google Cloud Run services** or utilize **Supabase Edge Function auth features**) to protect backend endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can access them and fetching the user's identity/roles (**from Supabase Auth**) for subsequent checks.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Middleware function created (**for Google Cloud Run, or utilize Supabase Edge Function auth helper**) that intercepts requests to protected routes.
        *   Middleware checks for a valid authentication token (JWT) in the request headers (`Authorization: Bearer ...`).
        *   **Utilizes Supabase JS SDK (or built-in Edge Function helpers) to verify token validity (`supabase.auth.getUser(token)` or similar logic) and retrieve the authenticated user's object/ID from Supabase Auth.**
        *   Looks up the corresponding user's roles (**from Supabase Auth `app_metadata` or related tables in Supabase**) and attaches user object/ID and roles to the request context (e.g., `req.user`).
        *   Allows valid requests to proceed, sends 401 Unauthorized for invalid/missing tokens.
        *   Apply this middleware to a non-auth endpoint to confirm functionality.
    *   **Technology/Implementation Suggestions:** Node.js/TypeScript middleware (**for Cloud Run**). **Supabase JS SDK Auth helpers**, **Supabase Edge Functions built-in auth helpers**.

3.  **Ticket ID:** SEC-BE-3 (UPDATED for Supabase RLS & Backend Checks)
    *   **Title:** Implement Core RBAC Enforcement (**Supabase RLS & Backend Checks**)
    *   **Background:** Build logic to enforce permissions based on user roles and data ownership, primarily leveraging **Supabase RLS**, supplemented by checks within backend code (**Cloud Run Functions/Services**) where RLS is insufficient (e.g., admin actions, complex data relationships).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Supabase RLS policies** designed and implemented for core data access scenarios based on user roles (`auth.role()`) and user ID (`auth.uid()`) on relevant tables.
        *   **Backend code (Cloud Run functions/services)** implements explicit authorization checks for complex scenarios or actions requiring elevated privileges (e.g., admin actions like managing any user profile, or processes needing to read potentially all sensitive data for aggregation/anonymization). These checks use user/role info from authenticated context (SEC-BE-2) and might involve querying `roles` or `user_roles` tables in **Supabase**.
        *   **Logic in backend code uses a Supabase `service_role` key *only when necessary* (e.g., for admin actions or data aggregation before anonymization)**, but *always* performs application-level authorization *after* obtaining the user context. Access using `service_role` is logged (SEC-A-1).
        *   Implement **Deny by Default** principle via **Supabase RLS** (it's deny by default unless `ALLOW` policies exist) and application code.
        *   Integrate this logic into at least one authenticated API endpoint (e.g., PROF-2, PROF-3) to verify enforcement.
        *   Admin actions and sensitive data access attempts logged (SEC-A-1).
    *   **Technology/Implementation Suggestions:** **Supabase RLS**, **Supabase JS SDK (`service_role` key usage)**, Node.js/TypeScript application logic (**in Cloud Run functions/services**).

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A secure client-side storage solution integrated (@react-native-community/keychain for native, potentially HttpOnly Secure cookies or similar for web).
        *   **Supabase Auth token** from successful login is stored using the secure solution.
        *   Stored token can be securely retrieved when needed for authenticated API calls (**to Supabase auto-generated APIs or Cloud Run functions**).
        *   Logout functionality removes the token securely from storage.
        *   Tested on both web and mobile platforms regarding storage location validity and security implications (OWASP Mobile Top 10, OWASP Web Security Testing Guide).
    *   **Technology/Implementation Suggestions:** `@react-native-community/keychain` for native. For web, prioritize HttpOnly Secure cookies over localStorage for JWTs; session IDs managed backend are also viable (if moving away from stateless Supabase JWTs). Node.js OWASP cheatsheet guidance. **Supabase JS SDK methods for session management.**

        *   Migration script created to update the database schema (**Supabase migrations**).
        *   Backend registration API (**FOUND-9 Cloud Run function**) modified to receive the user's consent selection and store it in the **Supabase `profiles` table**.
        *   Consent recording happens transactionally with user creation.
        *   **Supabase RLS policies reviewed/updated** to potentially restrict access to certain data based on consent status (implemented in later Epics like TRACKING).
    *   **Technology/Implementation Suggestions:** **Supabase PostgreSQL schema alterations, Supabase migrations**. Node.js/TypeScript logic (**in FOUND-9 Cloud Run function**).

6.  **Ticket ID:** SEC-FE-2 (UPDATED for Cloud Run endpoint)
    *   **Title:** Implement Frontend UI: Integrate DPA Consent into Registration
