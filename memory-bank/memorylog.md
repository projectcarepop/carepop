*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Modified `create_profiles_table` migration trigger to use `extensions.moddatetime()`. User manually ran `supabase db push` successfully, applying the migration. (FOUND-8)
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Committed profiles table migration file (FOUND-8).
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Reviewed Memory Bank. Proposed plan: Push FOUND-8 commit, implement profile creation on registration, commit/push, discuss RLS verification.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Pushed commit for FOUND-8 (Profiles migration) to origin main.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Implemented profile creation in `registerUserService` after successful signup (FOUND-9 TODO).
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Committed and pushed profile creation logic.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Manual RLS test failed to select user's own profile; investigation showed profile row did not exist for the test user (likely created before profile creation logic was added).
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Registration test with `@gmail.com` succeeded, confirming `@example.com` was blocked by Supabase (`email_address_invalid`).
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Restored `options.data` block in `signUp` call in `authService.ts`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Registration succeeded but profile creation failed due to schema mismatch (`consent_given` vs `granular_consents`). Corrected column name in `authService.ts` profile insert.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Profile creation still failed due to RLS violation (`new row violates row-level security policy`). Identified that anon key client lacked permission for insert.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Updated `supabaseClient.ts` to initialize and export a second client (`supabaseServiceRole`) using the service role key.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Updated `authService.ts` to use `supabaseServiceRole` client for the profile insert operation.

*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Decided to restart frontend implementation using a Monorepo structure (Turborepo/npm) with Next.js (web) + React Native CLI (native) and NativeWind, following a detailed frontend plan provided by the user. Previous frontend code/build setup discarded.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Attempted initial Turborepo setup; encountered errors. Deleted partial setup. Proceeding with fresh `npx create-turbo@latest` initialization.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Successfully initialized React Native app (`apps/nativeapp`) using interactive prompt (`npx @react-native-community/cli init --version 0.73.8`) after failures with non-interactive commands.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Added `dev` script to `apps/nativeapp/package.json`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Corrected Android SDK path format in `apps/nativeapp/android/local.properties`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Performed clean install (`rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install`) to fix workspace linking issues for `nativeapp`.

*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Corrected Android SDK path format (escaped backslashes) in `apps/nativeapp/android/local.properties`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Configured `apps/nativeapp/metro.config.js` with `watchFolders` and `nodeModulesPaths` for pnpm monorepo compatibility.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Successfully ran `pnpm run dev` from monorepo root; both `apps/web` (Next.js) and `apps/nativeapp` (Metro bundler) started correctly.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Conceptual Commit Point: Basic monorepo structure (`create-turbo`, `react-native init`, Metro config) completed and development environment (`pnpm run dev`) verified. Approved.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Configured Tailwind CSS for `apps/web` and created shared `@repo/tailwind-config` package.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Configured `packages/ui` for NativeWind and tested shared Button component in `apps/web` and `apps/nativeapp`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Encountered persistent Babel error (`.plugins is not a valid Plugin property`) in `apps/nativeapp` despite troubleshooting (React downgrade, cache clears, config changes).
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Pausing work. Next step is to investigate the root cause of the `nativeapp` Babel error.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Decided to remove NativeWind/Tailwind CSS from `apps/nativeapp` due to persistent build errors. Removed dependencies (`nativewind`, `tailwindcss`), updated `babel.config.js`, and modified shared UI component (`packages/ui/src/button.tsx`) to use `StyleSheet`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Encountered persistent Android build errors (`Could not read script ... native_modules.gradle`) due to pnpm hoisting.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Attempted fixes by adjusting `settings.gradle` paths and adding local dependencies failed to resolve Gradle script path issues.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Deleted `carepop-monorepo` again. Planning third attempt at initialization, including immediate configuration of pnpm hoisting via `.npmrc`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Initialized Turborepo (3rd attempt), created `.npmrc`, manually configured `apps/web` (Next.js, Tailwind), created `@repo/tailwind-config`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Resolved `apps/web` dev server errors (Tailwind config path, TS types).
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Initialized `apps/nativeapp` (RN CLI).
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Resolved Android Gradle build errors by modifying paths in `settings.gradle` and `app/build.gradle` to point to root `node_modules`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Resolved Metro bundler `Unable to resolve module` error by commenting out `blockList` entry in `metro.config.js`.
*   **Timestamp:** <placeholder_timestamp> - **Action:** Confirmed both `apps/web` and `apps/nativeapp` dev environments are functional. Monorepo setup complete.
*   **2024-08-28T14:00:00Z:** Reset frontend monorepo (`carepop-monorepo`) due to persistent, intractable build/cache errors after attempting NativeWind integration. Re-initialized with `pnpm create-turbo`.
*   **2024-08-28T14:30:00Z:** Configured `apps/web` with Tailwind CSS.
*   **2024-08-28T15:00:00Z:** Initialized `apps/nativeapp` and configured Metro for monorepo.
*   **2024-08-28T15:30:00Z:** Fixed Android Gradle build issues in `nativeapp` by adjusting `node_modules` paths in `settings.gradle` and `app/build.gradle`.
*   **2024-08-28T15:45:00Z:** Fixed Metro bundler error (`Unable to resolve module ../../Core/Devtools/parseErrorStack`) by adjusting `blockList` in `metro.config.js`.
*   **2024-08-28T16:00:00Z:** Resolved persistent RN rendering errors ("Objects are not valid...", "Text strings must...") in `nativeapp` via aggressive cleaning (Gradle, build folders, node_modules). Successfully rendered shared `@repo/ui/button` (using `title` prop) in `nativeapp`.
*   **2024-08-29T10:00:00Z:** Attempted to implement `styled-components` theming for `@repo/ui`.
*   **2024-08-29T10:30:00Z:** Reverted `@repo/ui` styling from `styled-components` back to `StyleSheet` due to persistent TypeScript type errors indicating conflicts between library versions (`@types/react-native`, core RN, `styled-components`).
*   **2024-08-29T10:45:00Z:** Configured Inter font for web (via `next/font/google`) and native (via manual asset linking + `react-native.config.js`). Updated theme and Button component to use Inter.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:07
  - **Action:** Simplified `Button.tsx` and `App.tsx` drastically to isolate persistent "Objects are not valid as a React child" error.
  - **Description:** Removed props, variants, and complex rendering logic. `App.tsx` now only renders one minimal button. Goal is to see if the error occurs even in the simplest possible case.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:15
  - **Action:** Modified `App.tsx` to render simple `<Text>` on cyan background, removing `@repo/ui` Button usage entirely.
  - **Description:** Repeating a previously successful debugging step to verify the basic React Native rendering pipeline before re-introducing the shared component. This helps determine if the error is fundamental to the RN setup or specific to the shared UI package interaction.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:25
  - **Action:** Added custom `resolveRequest` logging to `metro.config.js`. Restored minimal `@repo/ui` Button usage in `App.tsx`.
  - **Description:** To gain visibility into Metro's handling of the shared UI package, a custom resolver logs attempts to resolve `@repo/ui`. Minimal button usage is restored to trigger this resolution path during the next run.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:30
  - **Action:** Ran `nativeapp` with Metro resolver logging and minimal Button.
  - **Description:** The "Objects are not valid as a React child" error persisted. Awaiting user confirmation of Metro resolver logs to determine if `@repo/ui` was correctly located by the bundler.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:35
  - **Action:** Corrected Metro custom resolver logic.
  - **Description:** Fixed "defaultResolveRequest is not a function" error by using `context.resolveRequest` directly instead of attempting to use a previously extracted function reference.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:40
  - **Action:** Ran `nativeapp` after correcting Metro resolver logic.
  - **Description:** \"Objects are not valid...\" error still occurs. Still waiting for the critical `[Metro Resolver]` log output from the Metro bundler terminal to understand if `@repo/ui` is being resolved correctly.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:50
  - **Action:** Added further logging to `metro.config.js`.
  - **Description:** Added a top-level log to confirm file loading and modified the custom resolver to log *all* module resolution attempts, not just `@repo/ui`, because specific logging wasn't appearing.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 14:55
  - **Action:** Verified Metro resolves `@repo/ui` to `packages/ui/src/index.ts`. Verified `index.ts` exports `Button`. Changed `App.tsx` to import Button via direct path (`@repo/ui/src/button`).
  - **Description:** Confirmed module resolution is working. Testing if bypassing `index.ts` export affects the render error. Linter error for direct import is expected due to Metro config mapping only the root.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 15:05
  - **Action:** Encountered Metro internal error (`Got unexpected undefined`) when using direct import path. Cleared Metro cache manually. Reverted `App.tsx` import back to `@repo/ui`.
  - **Description:** The direct import path test led to a bundler error instead of the render error. Attempting cache clear and reverting to standard import path before further investigation.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 15:15
  - **Action:** Added explicit `react` and `react-native` mappings to `metro.config.js` `extraNodeModules`.
  - **Description:** Since the \"Objects are not valid...\" error persists despite confirmed module resolution, attempting a common workaround for potential duplicate React instances by forcing Metro to use the app's versions.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 15:35
  - **Action:** Reviewed `package.json` for `ui` and `nativeapp`. Set explicit `transformer.babelTransformerPath` in `metro.config.js`.
  - **Description:** Package dependencies and peer dependencies seem correctly configured. Explicitly setting the Babel transformer path is another attempt to ensure consistent code processing for shared packages.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 15:45
  - **Action:** Reset `metro.config.js`, restored previous working `Button.tsx` and `App.tsx`. Performed aggressive clean (Metro cache, Android build, `node_modules`) and started `pnpm install --force`.
  - **Description:** Attempting to fully restore the last known working state before the `styled-components` experiment caused instability. Cleaning steps executed successfully after quoting paths. Waiting for `pnpm install` to complete.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 16:00
  - **Action:** Successfully restored working state for `nativeapp`.
  - **Description:** After resetting `metro.config.js` to basic monorepo settings, restoring `Button.tsx` and `App.tsx` to their last known working (StyleSheet) versions, and performing an aggressive clean/reinstall, the \"Objects are not valid...\" rendering error is resolved. The shared Button component renders correctly in `nativeapp`.
*   **Date:** 2024-08-29 **Time:** 16:05
  - **Action:** Session End. Reviewed and updated Memory Bank (`epics_and_tickets.md`, `techContext.md`) to reflect resolution of native rendering errors and confirmation of `StyleSheet` styling approach.
  - **Description:** Project state is stable with `nativeapp` rendering shared UI correctly. Ready to continue UI component development in the next session.
