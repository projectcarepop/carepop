## Log Entries

*   **YYYY-MM-DD:** Initial Memory Bank Setup
    *   **Context:** Project kickoff / Czar agent initialization.
    *   **Decision/Change:** Created the 9 core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `epics_and_tickets.md`, `tracker.md`, `memorylog.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) with placeholder content.
    *   **Reasoning:** To establish the foundational documentation structure for the Czar agent.
    *   **Impact:** Provides a starting point for capturing all project knowledge and history.

*   **YYYY-MM-DD (AUTO_UPDATE_DATE):** Resolved Address Dropdown Issue on Web Create/Edit Profile Page
    *   **Context:** The dynamic address dropdowns (Province, City/Municipality, Barangay) on the `carepop-web/src/app/create-profile/page.tsx` were not functioning correctly due to missing data sources. Code review confirmed the page expects local JSON files.
    *   **Decision/Change:** Confirmed that `create-profile/page.tsx` fetches PSGC data from local JSON files: `provinces.json`, `cities-municipalities.json`, and `barangays.json` located in `carepop-web/public/data/psgc/`. The user has now placed/renamed these files correctly. This supersedes any previous notes about an external API for these specific dropdowns.
    *   **Reasoning:** To provide a reliable and local data source for PSGC information, ensuring the address selection dropdowns function as intended without external API dependencies for this part.
    *   **Impact:** The address selection dropdowns on the user profile page are now expected to be functional. This is a key step for `FE-PROFILE-1`. Further testing by the user is the next step for these fields.

*   **YYYY-MM-DD (AUTO_UPDATE_DATE):** Temporarily Changed Address Fields to Text Inputs on Web Profile Page
    *   **Context:** Ongoing issues with dropdowns (key warnings, not populating) for Province, City/Municipality, and Barangay on `carepop-web/src/app/create-profile/page.tsx`.
    *   **Decision/Change:** Modified `create-profile/page.tsx` to use simple `Input` (text) fields for `provinceCode`, `cityMunicipalityCode`, and `barangayCode` instead of `Select` components. Commented out related state variables and `useEffect` hooks for fetching/managing address list data.
    *   **Reasoning:** To allow user to proceed with profile creation/editing and other dependent tasks by bypassing the complex dropdown functionality for now. The root cause of dropdown issues (potentially non-unique keys in JSON data) can be investigated separately.
    *   **Impact:** Address fields are now free-text inputs. This simplifies the form temporarily but removes the structured selection. The `AddressSelectItem` interface was also removed as it became unused.
