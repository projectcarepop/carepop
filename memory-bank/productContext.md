\# Product Context: CarePoP/QueerCare

\#\# 1\. Why This Project Exists

This project aims to address significant barriers to healthcare access and efficiency in the Philippines, particularly for diverse and underserved communities in Quezon City. Key problems include:

\*   \*\*Inefficiency:\*\* Manual, paper-based workflows hinder timely and organized care.  
\*   \*\*Accessibility Gaps:\*\* Finding appropriate, trusted, and inclusive providers, especially those sensitive to Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) and LGBTQIA+ needs, is difficult. Digital access is inconsistent, and user tech literacy varies widely.  
\*   \*\*Information Barriers:\*\* Misinformation and societal stigma surrounding sensitive health topics prevent individuals from seeking necessary care and accessing reliable health information.  
\*   \*\*Data Fragmentation:\*\* Patients often lack a unified view of their health interactions, and providers may not have easy access to comprehensive patient history (with consent), hindering informed decision-making and continuity of care.

\#\# 2\. Problems It Solves

The CarePoP/QueerCare platform directly tackles these challenges by providing:

\*   \*\*Streamlined Workflows:\*\* Digitizing core processes like appointment scheduling and health data management through user-friendly interfaces on both native mobile (\`carepop-nativeapp\`) and web (\`carepop-web\`).  
\*   \*\*Improved Access to Care:\*\* Offering a centralized, easily searchable directory of vetted healthcare providers and facilities within Quezon City (initially), filterable by specialty and inclusive practices, accessible through both the native and web applications.  
\*   \*\*User Empowerment & Engagement:\*\* Providing tools for personal health management (medication tracking, menstrual cycle tracking) and access to their own health records and lab results within a secure environment, available on both native and web platforms.  
\*   \*\*Bridging Information Gaps:\*\* Creating a trusted digital space that inherently reduces barriers through accessibility and has the potential for future integration of curated health information. The inclusive design across both platforms aims to combat stigma.  
\*   \*\*Enhanced Data Access & Continuity:\*\* Establishing a secure, unified system (\`carepop-backend\` with Supabase) where users can manage their health information, and authorized providers (with explicit user consent, likely via the \`carepop-web\` admin/provider interface) can access relevant history for improved care coordination.

\#\# 3\. How It Should Work (User Experience Goals Across Platforms)

The entire CarePoP/QueerCare ecosystem, encompassing the \`carepop-nativeapp/\` (iOS/Android) and the separate \`carepop-web/\` application, must deliver a seamless and trustworthy experience characterized by:

\*   \*\*User-Centered & Intuitive:\*\* Simple, logical workflows, clear language, and minimal friction for completing key tasks (booking, finding info, tracking health) on both platforms.  
\*   \*\*Visually Appealing & Modern:\*\* Clean, contemporary design aesthetic using the chosen UI tools (StyleSheet/Theme for Native, Tailwind/Shadcn for Web) to build user confidence and align with modern application standards.  
\*   \*\*Inclusive & Respectful:\*\* Design, content, and features must be explicitly sensitive to SRH and LGBTQIA+ health needs, fostering a safe, welcoming, and non-judgmental digital environment on both native and web interfaces.  
\*   \*\*Accessible:\*\* Built to meet relevant accessibility standards (Mobile Accessibility Guidelines for native, WCAG for web) ensuring usability for individuals with disabilities.  
\*   \*\*Platform-Optimized:\*\* While maintaining brand consistency, the UI/UX should feel natural and performant on its respective platform (\`carepop-nativeapp\` optimized for touch and mobile interactions, \`carepop-web\` optimized for various screen sizes, SEO, and potentially more complex data display in admin sections).  
\*   \*\*Performant:\*\* Fast loading times, smooth transitions, and responsive interactions are critical on both the native app and the web application.  
\*   \*\*Trustworthy:\*\* Professional visual design, transparent communication about data privacy and security features (encryption, access controls), and clear links to FPOP branding reinforce credibility across all user touchpoints.

\#\# 4\. Target Audience Needs

\*   \*\*Diverse Communities (Quezon City):\*\* Primarily individuals needing SRH services, general consultations, support for family planning, and including a specific focus on the LGBTQIA+ community. Extends to broader underserved populations facing healthcare access barriers.  
\*   \*\*Varying Tech Literacy:\*\* The interface design for \*both\* native and web applications must be extremely clear, simple, and forgiving, avoiding complex jargon or requiring advanced digital skills.  
\*   \*\*Need for Trust & Confidentiality:\*\* Users handle highly sensitive personal information (health status, SRH details, gender identity). The platform \*must\* provide robust security and clearly communicate its privacy commitment to gain and maintain user trust.  
\*   \*\*Specific Health Tools:\*\* Clear demand for easy online appointment booking, finding trusted/affirming providers, medication adherence tools (Pill Tracker), and personal health logging (Menstrual Tracker).

\#\# 5\. High-Level Vision Summary

CarePoP/QueerCare aims to be the go-to digital health platform for accessible, inclusive, and secure SRH and related healthcare needs for diverse communities in Quezon City. It will provide functional parity (where appropriate) across its native mobile (\`carepop-nativeapp\`) and comprehensive web (\`carepop-web\`) applications, both powered by a secure and reliable backend (\`carepop-backend\`), ultimately improving health outcomes and user empowerment.
