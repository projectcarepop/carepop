# Product Context: CarePoP/QueerCare

## 1. Why This Project Exists

This project aims to address significant barriers to healthcare access and efficiency in the Philippines, particularly for diverse and underserved communities in Quezon City. Key problems include:

*   **Inefficiency:** Manual, paper-based workflows are common, hindering timely care.
*   **Accessibility Gaps:** Finding appropriate providers, especially those sensitive to SRH and LGBTQIA+ needs, is difficult. Digital integration is lacking, and tech literacy varies.
*   **Information Barriers:** Misinformation and stigma surrounding sensitive health topics (SRH, LGBTQIA+ health) prevent individuals from seeking care.
*   **Data Fragmentation:** Patients and providers lack easy access to comprehensive health information, hindering informed decision-making.

## 2. Problems It Solves

The platform aims to directly tackle the challenges above by:

*   **Streamlining Workflows:** Digitizing appointment scheduling and potentially other administrative tasks.
*   **Improving Access:** Providing a centralized, searchable directory of vetted providers and facilities, accessible via a **dedicated `carepop-nativeapp/` (iOS/Android)** and a **separate, comprehensive `carepop-web/` application**.
*   **Empowering Users:** Offering tools for health tracking (medication, menstrual cycles) and providing access to personal health records and lab results through both the native and web applications.
*   **Bridging Information Gaps:** Offering a trusted platform for health information (implicitly through provider access and potential future content features) and potentially reducing stigma through inclusive design in both the native and web applications.
*   **Enhancing Data Access:** Creating a unified system where users can view their health information (via both native and web apps) and providers can access relevant patient data (with consent, likely via the `carepop-web/` application for admin tasks).

## 3. How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

The platform (encompassing the `carepop-nativeapp/` and the separate `carepop-web/` application) must be:

*   **User-Centered & Intuitive:** Workflows should be simple and logical, using clear language in both applications.
*   **Visually Appealing & Modern:** A clean, contemporary aesthetic builds trust across both applications.
*   **Inclusive & Respectful:** Design and content must be sensitive to SRH and LGBTQIA+ needs, creating a safe space in both applications.
*   **Accessible:** Adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG principles for web, mobile accessibility guidelines for native).
*   **Optimized for Platform:** Provide a seamless and high-quality experience tailored to each distinct application (**`carepop-nativeapp/` for on-the-go mobile interactions, `carepop-web/` for broader access and administrative tasks**).
*   **Performant:** Fast loading and smooth interactions are key for both applications.
*   **Trustworthy:** Professional design and clear communication about security and privacy are essential across both applications, especially given the sensitive nature of the data.

## 4. Target Audience Needs

*   **Diverse Communities (Quezon City):** Including those seeking SRH services, general consultations, and LGBTQIA+ individuals.
*   **Varying Tech Literacy:** Requires an exceptionally easy-to-use interface.
*   **Need for Trust:** Users require assurance of privacy, security, and respectful treatment.
*   **Specific Health Tools:** Demand for features like appointment booking, provider finding, medication tracking, and menstrual cycle tracking.
