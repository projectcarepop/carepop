# Project Progress: CarePop/QueerCare

## Current Status (As of TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW)

Focus remains on resolving critical issues in the `carepop-mobile` application: the persistent navigation error from `MyProfileScreen` and the "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" warning. `App.tsx` has been identified as the active navigation root, and configuration changes have been made there.

## What Works (Verified in Current Structure)

*   Supabase Trigger (FOUND-9): Implemented and confirmed by the user for automatic profile creation.
*   `App.tsx` Navigation Structure (Initial):
    *   `MyProfileStack` (containing `MyProfileScreen` as "MyProfileMain" and `EditProfileScreen` as "EditProfile") is defined.
    *   This stack is integrated as the component for the "My Profile" drawer item in `MainAppDrawer`.
    *   `EditProfileScreen` imported; `MyProfileScreen.tsx` navigation call updated to `navigation.navigate('EditProfile');`.
*   UI Update (`ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx`): Text title successfully replaced with the app logo image.
*   Core Project Structure & Basic Init: The three-pillar structure (\`carepop-backend/\`, \`carepop-mobile/\`, \`carepop-web/\`) is established. Basic app initialization for mobile and backend works.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Focus from `tracker.md`)

*   Resolve "NAVIGATE... not handled" Error: Determine why `MyProfileScreen`, when rendered via `App.tsx`'s `MainAppDrawer > MyProfileStack`, cannot navigate to "EditProfile". This involves analyzing `AppContent` state and rendering logic.
*   Resolve "Text strings..." Warning: Identify and fix the source of raw string rendering within `App.tsx` or its child UI components (Onboarding, SplashScreen).
*   Full Profile Flow (Post-Error Fix): Thoroughly test Create Profile -> View Profile (`MyProfileScreen`) -> Edit Profile (`EditProfileScreen`) -> Save Profile flow once navigation is unblocked.
*   Stabilize Onboarding Flow: Re-enable and test AsyncStorage logic for `hasOnboarded` state persistence in `App.tsx` once current errors are cleared.
*   Continue Implementing Other Features: Address other "To Do" tickets from `epics_and_tickets.md` once these foundational/blocking issues are resolved.

## Known Issues & Blockers (Current)

1.  CRITICAL: Navigation Error: `The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {"name":"EditProfile"} was not handled by any navigator.` Persists. Suspected cause: `MainAppDrawer` or `MyProfileStack` not being correctly active or available in the navigation context of `MyProfileScreen` due to `App.tsx`'s conditional rendering.
2.  CRITICAL: Text Rendering Warning: `Warning: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.` Call stack points to `App (<anonymous>)`, indicating an issue in `App.tsx` or components it renders (e.g., Onboarding, SplashScreen).

## Key Decisions & Evolutions Log

*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Decision: `App.tsx` is the primary focus for mobile navigation setup and debugging. `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` is likely unused or its role needs clarification.
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: Supabase trigger for profile creation (`FOUND-9`) confirmed as implemented.
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: `MyProfileStack` (with `MyProfileScreen`, `EditProfileScreen`) defined and integrated into `MainAppDrawer` within `App.tsx`.
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: `ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx` UI updated to use logo.
