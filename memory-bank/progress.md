# Project Progress Summary (CarePop)

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD (AUTO_UPDATE_DATE)

## Overall Project Status:
*   **Focus:** Diagnosing and resolving CORS issue preventing `carepop-web` (local) from fetching profiles from the deployed `carepop-backend-staging` on Cloud Run.
*   **Previous Success:** The redirect loop between profile creation and dashboard on `carepop-web` was resolved.
*   **Current Blocker:** `TypeError: Failed to fetch` when `AuthContext.tsx` calls the backend API, identified as a CORS issue by browser dev tools.
*   **Backend:** Supabase `handle_new_user` trigger is stable. Cloud Run environment variables (KMS, Supabase URL/Key) were previously reviewed and believed to be set.

## Epic-Level Status Summary (from `tracker.md`):
*   **EPIC-001 (Foundational Setup & User Authentication):** Web auth/profile/dashboard features (`TICKET-004`, `TICKET-005`, `TICKET-WEB-PROF-1`, `TICKET-WEB-DASH-1`) are currently **blocked** by the CORS issue with the deployed backend. The redirect loop fix remains in place.
*   **EPIC-LEGAL (Legal Pages):** To Do.

## What Works:
*   Native app: Core auth and profile features remain stable.
*   Supabase: `handle_new_user` trigger.
*   `carepop-web` (conceptually, when not blocked):
    *   Resolved redirect loop for profile completion.
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` has improved logic for session management and profile fetching (key mapping).
*   `carepop-backend` (local `server.ts`): Contains a CORS configuration that should allow `http://localhost:3000`.

## What's Next (Immediate Focus based on `activeContext.md`):
1.  **Resolve CORS issue with deployed `carepop-backend-staging`:**
    *   Ensure the deployed backend code on Cloud Run accurately reflects the CORS configuration in the local `server.ts`.
    *   Verify Cloud Run logs for the deployed service for any CORS-related messages or other errors when the frontend attempts to connect.
    *   Examine browser network tab for `OPTIONS` preflight request details.

## Known High-Level Issues/Blockers:
*   **Primary Blocker: CORS issue** preventing `carepop-web` from communicating with the deployed `carepop-backend-staging` for profile data.
*   Address input on `carepop-web/create-profile` is a temporary text field solution (secondary to CORS).
*   Full email-related auth flow testing requires Supabase email provider setup by the user.

## Key Achievements Recently:
*   **Diagnosed `TypeError: Failed to fetch` as a CORS issue** when local frontend connects to deployed Cloud Run backend.
*   Previously fixed `carepop-web` Profile/Dashboard redirect loop.
*   Identified that local `carepop-backend/src/server.ts` has a CORS setup.

**Memory Bank File Status:**
*   `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `epics_and_tickets.md` reviewed and stable.
*   `tracker.md`: Updated to reflect CORS blocker.
*   `memorylog.md`: Updated with CORS issue diagnosis.
*   `activeContext.md`: To be updated.
*   `progress.md`: This document, updated.

## Project Progress (CarePoP Platform)

**Overall Status:** `carepop-web` MVP development has made significant strides. The critical redirect loop is fixed, making auth, profile, and dashboard flows functional.

**Current Focus Pillar:** `carepop-web`

**Key Achievements Recently:**
*   **FIXED: `carepop-web` Profile/Dashboard Redirect Loop:** Implemented snake_case to camelCase key mapping in `AuthContext.tsx` `fetchProfile`.
*   **`carepop-web` - `AuthContext.tsx` Maturity:** Enhanced robustness through debugging and key mapping.
*   **`carepop-web` - Core User Flows:** Registration, Login, Profile Creation (text address), and Dashboard display are now working without the redirect loop.

**What's Working:**
*   All previously working items, plus:
*   Correct navigation to `/dashboard` after profile completion.
*   Reliable profile data handling in `AuthContext.tsx` due to correct key mapping.

**What's Next (Immediate Focus for `carepop-web` based on `activeContext.md` - for next session):**
1.  **Full E2E testing of all `carepop-web` authentication and profile features.**
2.  Plan and implement dynamic address dropdowns for the profile page.

**Key Blockers/Issues:**
*   Temporary text address fields in profile form.
*   User action needed for Supabase email provider setup.

## Overall Project Progress (Czar)

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD (AUTO_UPDATE_DATE)

**Current Phase:** MVP Development - `carepop-web` core features stabilized.

**High-Level Summary:**
Significant progress: the critical redirect loop on `carepop-web` has been resolved by implementing snake_case to camelCase key mapping in `AuthContext.tsx` when fetching profile data. This stabilizes the core user flow from registration/login through profile creation to dashboard display. `AuthContext.tsx` is now more robust.

The `create-profile` page (with temporary text address fields) and `dashboard` page are functioning as expected regarding navigation and data display.

The system is ready for comprehensive end-to-end testing of these web features in the next session.

**Key Accomplishments Recently:**
*   **Resolved critical redirect loop** on `carepop-web` by fixing key casing mismatch in `AuthContext.tsx`.
*   Stabilized core auth, profile, and dashboard functionality on the web platform.

**Current Blockers/Risks:**
*   Address fields on `create-profile` are a temporary solution.
*   Comprehensive testing pending.

**Next Steps (based on `activeContext.md` - for next session):
*   Full end-to-end testing of `carepop-web` auth, profile, and dashboard.
*   Plan replacement of text address fields with dynamic dropdowns.

**Overall Confidence:** High. The major blocker is resolved. The system is in a good state for thorough testing.
