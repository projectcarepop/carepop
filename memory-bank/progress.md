# Project Progress Summary (CarePop)

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD (AUTO_UPDATE_DATE)

## Overall Project Status:
*   **BACKEND FIXED:** The `carepop-backend-staging` service's `PATCH /api/users/profile` endpoint is now functional. The HTTP 500 error (caused by KMS configuration issues, specifically the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` environment variable mismatch) has been resolved by the user.
*   **Focus:** Comprehensive E2E testing of `carepop-web` authentication, profile creation/editing, and dashboard flows. Theme hover color updated.

## Epic-Level Status Summary (from `tracker.md`):
*   **EPIC-001 (Foundational Setup & User Authentication):** Web profile creation/update (`TICKET-WEB-PROF-1`) and Dashboard display (`TICKET-WEB-DASH-1`) have seen significant UI and functional improvements. Both are ready for E2E testing.

## What Works:
*   `carepop-backend-staging` is fully operational, including `PATCH /api/users/profile` for profile updates with encryption.
*   GET requests to `/api/users/profile` are processed.
*   Local `carepop-web` and `carepop-mobile` can run.
*   Local `carepop-backend` (with local .env) should be functional.
*   `carepop-web` profile creation/editing page: Submit button works, address fields use searchable Combobox.
*   `carepop-web` dashboard: Displays full address names.
*   Theme-wide hover/accent color updated to a lighter primary shade.

## What's Next (Immediate Focus based on `activeContext.md`):
1.  **Comprehensive E2E Testing of `carepop-web`:**
    *   User Registration (TICKET-004)
    *   User Login (TICKET-005)
    *   Profile Creation & Editing (TICKET-WEB-PROF-1)
    *   Dashboard Display & Prompts (TICKET-WEB-DASH-1)
2.  **Plan & Implement Address Dropdown Solution** for the profile page.
3.  **Update `epics_and_tickets.md` and `tracker.md`** based on testing and new tasks.

## Known High-Level Issues/Blockers:
*   **None critical.** The primary backend blocker is resolved.
*   Address fields on `carepop-web` profile page are still temporary text inputs.

## Key Achievements Recently:
*   **CRITICAL FIX: User resolved the HTTP 500 error on `PATCH /api/users/profile` on `carepop-backend-staging`** by correcting the KMS configuration (ensuring `GCP_PROJECT_ID` environment variable name was correct).
*   **UI/UX Enhancements on `carepop-web`:**
    *   Fixed "Submit Profile" button on `/create-profile`.
    *   Implemented searchable `Combobox` for address selection on `/create-profile`.
    *   Dashboard now displays full address names (province, city, barangay).
    *   Updated theme-wide hover/accent color for better brand consistency.
*   Successfully debugged PSGC data filtering for barangays on `/create-profile`.
*   Resolved `carepop-backend-staging` startup failures by fixing initially missing environment variable configurations.
*   Narrowed down the frontend "Failed to fetch" issue to a specific HTTP 500 error on profile PATCH requests to the backend.
*   Identified `EncryptionService.encrypt()` as the failure point via backend logs.
*   Pinpointed the exact error message (`KMS configuration is incomplete. Cannot encrypt.`) and its origin in `EncryptionService`.
*   **Crucially, identified the root cause: a mismatch between the expected environment variable name `GCP_PROJECT_ID` (in `config/config.ts`) and the likely actual name used in the Cloud Run service configuration for the KMS Project ID.**

**Memory Bank File Status:**
*   `memorylog.md`: To be updated with the backend fix confirmation.
*   `activeContext.md`: Updated to reflect backend fix and shift focus to E2E testing.
*   `progress.md`: This document, updated to reflect the unblocked status.

## Project Progress (CarePoP Platform)

**Overall Status:** `carepop-web` MVP development has made significant strides. The critical redirect loop is fixed, making auth, profile, and dashboard flows functional.

**Current Focus Pillar:** `carepop-web`

**Key Achievements Recently:**
*   **FIXED: `carepop-web` Profile/Dashboard Redirect Loop:** Implemented snake_case to camelCase key mapping in `AuthContext.tsx` `fetchProfile`.
*   **`carepop-web` - `AuthContext.tsx` Maturity:** Enhanced robustness through debugging and key mapping.
*   **`carepop-web` - Core User Flows:** Registration, Login, Profile Creation (text address), and Dashboard display are now working without the redirect loop.

**What's Working:**
*   All previously working items, plus:
*   Correct navigation to `/dashboard` after profile completion.
*   Reliable profile data handling in `AuthContext.tsx` due to correct key mapping.

**What's Next (Immediate Focus for `carepop-web` based on `activeContext.md` - for next session):**
1.  **Full E2E testing of all `carepop-web` authentication and profile features.**
2.  Plan and implement dynamic address dropdowns for the profile page.

**Key Blockers/Issues:**
*   Temporary text address fields in profile form.
*   User action needed for Supabase email provider setup.

## Overall Project Progress (Czar)

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD (AUTO_UPDATE_DATE)

**Current Phase:** MVP Development - `carepop-web` core features stabilized.

**High-Level Summary:**
Significant progress: the critical redirect loop on `carepop-web` has been resolved by implementing snake_case to camelCase key mapping in `AuthContext.tsx` when fetching profile data. This stabilizes the core user flow from registration/login through profile creation to dashboard display. `AuthContext.tsx` is now more robust.

The `create-profile` page (with temporary text address fields) and `dashboard` page are functioning as expected regarding navigation and data display.

The system is ready for comprehensive end-to-end testing of these web features in the next session.

**Key Accomplishments Recently:**
*   **Resolved critical redirect loop** on `carepop-web` by fixing key casing mismatch in `AuthContext.tsx`.
*   Stabilized core auth, profile, and dashboard functionality on the web platform.
*   **Significant UI/UX improvements** on `carepop-web` profile creation and dashboard pages (Combobox, address name display, submit button fix, hover color theming).

**Current Blockers/Risks:**
*   Comprehensive testing pending.

**Next Steps (based on `activeContext.md` - for next session):
*   Full end-to-end testing of `carepop-web` auth, profile, and dashboard.

**Overall Confidence:** High. Major blockers are resolved. Web UI and functionality have been significantly improved. The system is in a good state for thorough testing.
