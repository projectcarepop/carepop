# Project Progress: CarePoP/QueerCare

## Current Status (As of TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW)

The "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" warning has been resolved (apparently due to specific comment syntax). The critical blocker remains the navigation error from `MyProfileScreen`. Focus is on `App.tsx` as the active navigation root.

## What Works (Verified in Current Structure)

*   Supabase Trigger (FOUND-9): Implemented and confirmed by the user for automatic profile creation.
*   `App.tsx` Navigation Structure (Initial):
    *   `MyProfileStack` (containing `MyProfileScreen` as "MyProfileMain" and `EditProfileScreen` as "EditProfile") is defined.
    *   `MainAppDrawer` (including `MyProfileStack`) is defined.
    *   Drawer icons standardized to Ionicons.
*   Onboarding Screens (UI): Basic UI for `OnboardingScreenOne`, `Two`, and `Three` implemented, potential text warning issue resolved, unused navigation props removed.
*   ForgotPasswordScreen UI: Logo added, text updated.
*   Core Project Structure & Basic Init: The three-pillar structure (\`carepop-backend/\`, \`carepop-mobile/\`, \`carepop-web/\`) is established. Basic app initialization for mobile and backend works.

## What's Next / In Progress (Immediate Focus)

1.  Resolve Persistent Navigation Error: `MyProfileScreen` navigation to `EditProfileScreen` (within `App.tsx` context). This is the highest priority.
2.  Validate Onboarding Flow: Ensure the Carousel in `App.tsx` correctly displays onboarding screens and the `handleOnboardingComplete` function transitions to the main app state (Auth/CreateProfile/MainAppDrawer).
3.  Integrate Auth Flow: Connect Login/Register UI to Supabase auth calls (after navigation is stable).

## What's Left to Build (Post-Navigation/Auth MVP Fixes)

*   Complete implementation of all nested stack navigators (Appointments, Health Buddy).
*   Full implementation of core features (Booking, Records, Health Buddy features, etc.).
*   Web Application (`carepop-web/`) development (most features are P2/P3).
*   Backend (`carepop-backend/`) development for non-Supabase-direct features.
*   Comprehensive Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E).
*   CI/CD pipelines for all three pillars.

## Known Issues & Blockers

*   Critical: `MyProfileScreen` cannot navigate to `EditProfileScreen` (error: "NAVIGATE with payload {\"name\":\"EditProfile\"} was not handled by any navigator"). This blocks testing of profile editing and potentially other authenticated flows.

## Key Decisions & Evolutions Log

*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Decision: `App.tsx` is the primary focus for mobile navigation setup and debugging. `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` is likely unused or its role needs clarification.
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: Supabase trigger for profile creation (`FOUND-9`) confirmed as implemented.
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: `ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx` UI updated (logo added).
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: Memory Bank files reformatted for readability.
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: Resolved "Text strings..." warning (related to comments), cleaned onboarding props, standardized drawer icons.
*   TIMESTAMP_OF_MEMORY_BANK_AUG_2_2024_REVIEW - Action: Committed and pushed recent changes (Memory Bank, UI, code cleanup) to Git (Commit: 9b848e6).
