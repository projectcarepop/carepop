# Project Brief: CarePoP/QueerCare Integrated Healthcare Platform

## 1. Project Name

CarePoP / QueerCare (Integrated Healthcare Platform)

## 2. Client/Partner

Family Planning Organization of the Philippines (FPOP)

## 3. Vision

To enhance healthcare accessibility and efficiency, particularly for diverse and underserved communities in the Philippines, through a secure, user-friendly, and inclusive digital platform.

## 4. Core Problem

The platform addresses inefficiencies in manual healthcare workflows, lack of digital integration, fragmented service access, misinformation/stigma around sensitive health topics, and limited access to comprehensive health data for patients and providers, especially within underserved communities in Quezon City, Philippines.

## 5. Solution Approach

Develop an integrated, cross-platform (web and mobile) digital application using React Native. The platform will feature a user-centered design emphasizing accessibility, security, and inclusivity. A modern, visually appealing interface is required. The backend architecture will utilize a hybrid approach with Supabase (PostgreSQL DB, Auth, RLS, Storage, Functions) for core BaaS features and Google Cloud Run for custom backend logic, integrations, and background tasks. Rigorous security controls (application-level encryption, RLS) and compliance with the Philippines Data Privacy Act (DPA RA 10173) are mandatory. Public-facing web components (like the Provider Directory) must be discoverable via search engines (SEO).

## 6. Target Audience

Individuals from diverse communities in Quezon City, including those seeking family planning, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, general consultations, and those identifying as LGBTQIA+, extending to a broader underserved population. The platform must be approachable and trustworthy for users with varying tech literacy.
