# Epic & Ticket Tracker

**CRITICAL NOTE ON CURRENT STATUS (As of <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ_PLACEHOLDER>):**
**The project is undergoing a major architectural and structural refactor.**
-   The old `carepop-frontend` monorepo is being dismantled.
-   The project will now consist of three top-level directories: `carepop-backend/`, `carepop-nativeapp/`, and `carepop-web/` within the main `https://github.com/projectcarepop/carepop.git` repository.
-   A **force push to the `main` branch is imminent** to reflect this new structure, which will reset the commit history on `main`.
-   `epics_and_tickets.md` is being updated, and this `tracker.md` will require a full review and update of individual ticket statuses *after* the restructure is complete and `epics_and_tickets.md` is finalized.
-   **Assume all current ticket statuses below are potentially outdated until this review is complete.**

**Note on Current Status (Post-Architectural Pivot):** This tracker reflects the project state after a major architectural shift to a **dual-frontend system**.
1.  **Native Mobile App:** Expo (React Native) for iOS & Android (`apps/nativeapp`).
2.  **Separate Web Application:** New project (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI - development pending).
Backend (Supabase + Cloud Run) serves both. Ticket IDs, scopes, statuses, and **Acceptance Criteria (AC)** have been updated accordingly. Many UI feature tickets are "To Do" or "In Progress" (UI scaffolding complete, functional integration pending ACs).

**Previous Deviation Note (<Current Date Placeholder>):** Significant deviation occurred. Instead of proceeding with AUTH-3 (Google Login) or AUTH-4 (Login UI), focus shifted entirely to scaffolding numerous placeholder UI screens and refining navigation patterns within the Expo `nativeapp`. This involved creating screens beyond the initial MVP scope (Trackers, detailed Profile) and implementing an authentication bypass. The original goal of having a functional authentication flow is now blocked by potential Metro/API issues and the bypass itself.
